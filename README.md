# Keep Awake

You might meet the situation that you need to run a program taking couple hours, and you just go to have a couple of coffee. Then, after you come back, you found that the your program has been stopped because your computer sleeps and turns down the network. Unfortunately, you have to re-run whole the process again...

`keep_awake` is a command to keep your computer awake! There is nothing magic but just moves you mouse cursor 1px every 60 seconds.

# Usage

```bash
npm install # only run once to install package dependencies

./keep_awake
```
